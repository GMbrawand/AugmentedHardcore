#Which type of ban should LiteDeathBan enforce when death banning a player?
# -> name/ip
BanType: name

#What ban time type should be used for calculating the bantime?
#Static:             Above times will be used for bans.
#BanCount:           The amount of times death banned * 35 will be used for determining the bantime.
#                    Bantimes will increase the more death banned the player has been.
#                    Above times will be used as maximum ban time.
#Playtime:           Playtime will be used for determining the bantime.
#                    Bantimes will increase the more playtime the player has.
#                    Above times will be used as maximum ban time.
#Timesincelastdeath: Time since last death will be used for determining the bantime.
#                    Bantimes will increase the longer the player stays alive.
#                    Every death will reset the bantime back to 0, above times will be used as maximum ban time.
# -> static/bancount/playtime/timesincelastdeath

#At what rate should the ban time by playtime grow?
#Linear:      a constant increase in bantime the more bancount/playtime/timesincelastdeath(P) you have (constant increase) [(P/.65) OR MBT]. MBT -> max ban time
#exponential: a proportional growth to the current bancount/playtime/timesincelastdeath(P) (slow increase at start, rapid increase at the middle/end) [(.65*(P)^(P/MBT+.65)) OR MBT]. MBT -> max ban time
